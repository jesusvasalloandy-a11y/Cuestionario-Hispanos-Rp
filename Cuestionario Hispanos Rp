    <h1>GTA Roleplay Server Onboarding Questionnaire</h1>
    <p><em>Welcome to our GTA roleplay server! This questionnaire ensures you're ready to dive into the immersive world of Los Santos (or your server's setting). Answer honestly to help us match you with the right experience. If you're unsure, check our wiki or Discord for details.</em></p>

    <form action="#" method="post"> <!-- Cambia "#" por tu endpoint si tienes backend -->

        <h2>1. Introduction to the Server</h2>
        <label for="motivation">Question 1: What is your primary motivation for joining a GTA roleplay server? (e.g., storytelling, action, community interaction)</label>
        <input type="text" id="motivation" name="motivation" required>
        <p class="tip">Tip: GTA RP focuses on roleplaying as civilians, criminals, or law enforcement in a simulated city. It's not just shooting—it's about character-driven narratives.</p>

        <label for="experience">Question 2: Have you played GTA roleplay before (e.g., on FiveM, RageMP, or similar)? Yes/No. If yes, briefly describe your experience.</label>
        <textarea id="experience" name="experience" rows="3"></textarea>
        <p class="tip">Tip: If you're new, don't worry—we have tutorials! Experienced players should still review our rules to avoid common pitfalls.</p>

        <h2>2. Rules and Etiquette</h2>
        <label>Question 3: Do you understand and agree to follow these core rules? (Select all that apply)</label>
        <input type="checkbox" name="rules[]" value="No metagaming"> No metagaming (using out-of-character knowledge in RP).<br>
        <input type="checkbox" name="rules[]" value="No powergaming"> No powergaming (forcing unrealistic actions on others).<br>
        <input type="checkbox" name="rules[]" value="Respect all players"> Respect all players, no harassment or toxicity.<br>
        <input type="checkbox" name="rules[]" value="Follow server laws"> Follow server-specific laws (e.g., no random killing without RP justification).<br>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Violations can lead to bans. Our server emphasizes fair play to keep the RP authentic and enjoyable.</p>

        <label for="rule_break">Question 4: What would you do if another player breaks a rule during RP? (e.g., report to admins, ignore and continue, confront in-character)</label>
        <input type="text" id="rule_break" name="rule_break" required>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Always report issues to staff via /report command. In-character conflicts should stay in RP.</p>

        <h2>3. Roleplay Basics</h2>
        <label for="scenario">Question 5: Describe a basic RP scenario: You're a rookie cop pulling over a suspicious driver. How would you handle it in-character? (Open-ended)</label>
        <textarea id="scenario" name="scenario" rows="4" required></textarea>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Use /me for actions (e.g., /me pulls out badge) and /do for outcomes (e.g., /do The driver complies). Keep it immersive—avoid memes or real-life references.</p>

        <label for="mature">Question 6: Are you comfortable with mature themes like crime, violence, or adult content in RP? Yes/No.</label>
        <select id="mature" name="mature" required>
            <option value="">Select</option>
            <option value="Yes">Yes</option>
            <option value="No">No</option>
        </select>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Our server allows dark RP (e.g., heists, gangs), but it must be consensual and not graphic without warning.</p>

        <h2>4. Character Development</h2>
        <label for="character_type">Question 7: What type of character are you interested in creating? (e.g., civilian, gangster, business owner, law enforcement)</label>
        <input type="text" id="character_type" name="character_type" required>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Characters must fit the GTA lore—e.g., no superheroes. Start simple and build backstory via RP.</p>

        <label for="backstory">Question 8: How will you ensure your character has a unique backstory and avoids stereotypes? (Open-ended)</label>
        <textarea id="backstory" name="backstory" rows="3" required></textarea>
        <p class="tip">Tip: Use tools like our character creator app. Avoid "edgy" tropes; focus on depth for better RP interactions.</p>

        <h2>5. Server Features</h2>
        <label>Question 9: Which server features interest you most? (Select all that apply)</label>

        <input type="checkbox" name="features[]" value="Events"> Events and storylines.<br>

        <label for="questions">Question 10: Do you have any questions about server mechanics, like scripting or mods? (Open-ended)</label>
        <textarea id="questions" name="questions" rows="3"></textarea>
        <p class="tip">Tip: We use [e.g., FiveM] with custom scripts for realism. Tutorials are available in-game.</p>

        <h2>6. Joining Process</h2>
        <label for="username">Question 11: What is your preferred username and Discord handle for verification?</label>
